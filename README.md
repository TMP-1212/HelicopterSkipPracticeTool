# HelicopterSkipPracticeTool

Inspired by https://github.com/pellsson/smb.

This is a speedrun practice tool that simulates the Helicopter Skip strategy in the Happy Wheels level "Dawn of the Dead.lv1". The graphics were built from 347 screenshots of the level being played in the flash demo of the real game. This tool allows for better practice through its added features that aren't available in the real game. These features include save states for retrying specific scenarios instantly, custom framerate for slowing down or speeding up the simulation, and pausing on failed inputs to see exactly what frame the error occurred on.

This is a fan-made practice tool of the game Happy Wheels. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Fancy Force, LLC in any way. All trademarks, copyrights, and intellectual property belong to their respective owners. This project is entirely non-commercial.
